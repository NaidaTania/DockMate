# Major Group Project
The starter code for the major group project.

Group members (3-5) (no Student IDs, only names):
1. Sunny Cho @ [Sunnyc317](https://github.com/Sunnyc317)
2. Jessica @ [jwdjj](https://github.com/jwdjj)
3. Naida Tania @ [NaidaTania](https://github.com/NaidaTania)

## Overview
This application is to provide students to find housing easier

## How to run

1. Clone this repository, all the **final work is under master branch**
2. Run `cd dockmate`
3. Run `flutter run`

## What to Expect

1. The login authentication is not in place yet, so you can just click login/next to the main features
2. Some of the code is still hardcoded or some button aren't functional yet, on those cases, most likely commented in the code

## Demo

## Functional Requirements

1. Multiple screens/navigation
2. Dialogs and pickers (in forms and e.g. delete confirmation)
3. Notifications (after registration)
4. Snackbars (e.g. after saving a post, save button isn't functional yet)
5. Local storage (SQLite to bind user state in the app)
6. Cloud storage (Firestore, for now data for "listings" and "chats" are from Firestore)
